# Getting a Git Repository

## Local repository
A **local** repository is a repository (basically a folder) located in your hard drive. It is local as opposed to the **remote** repository which is hosted on Github, Bitbucket or other remote version control repository host.

To initialise a local repository, just change (`cd`) into the directory which you would like to be a repository and enter `git init`. This just marks the current directory as a repository.

**NB**: You only need to initialise a repository **once.**

## Remote repository
A **remote** repository is hosted online. The most popular remote git repository host include Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab. Before initialising a repository, one has to create an account on one of these hosts afterwhich you just create a repository.

If you do not have a local copy of the repository, you might want to initialise the remote repository with a README and a LICENSE.

Henceforth, the basic procedure is:

`git add <filename(s)>`

`git commit [-m][message]`

`git push [options]`
