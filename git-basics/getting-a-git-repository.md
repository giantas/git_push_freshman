# Getting a Git Repository

## Local repository
A **local** repository is a repository (basically a folder) located in your hard drive. It is local as opposed to the **remote** repository which is hosted on Github, Bitbucket or other remote version control repository host.

To initialise a local repository, just change (`cd`) into the directory which you would like to be a repository and enter `git init`. This just marks the current directory as a repository.

**NB**: You only need to initialise a repository **once.**

Henceforth, the basic procedure is:

`git add <filename(s)>`

`git commit [-m][message]`

`git push [options]`
