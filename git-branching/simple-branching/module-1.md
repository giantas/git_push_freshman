Consider the following scenario. You are working on your project \(a web app\) and already have a few commits as shown in the figure below:

**A short, simple history**

You decide to work on a given issue - \_issue53, \_in whatever issue tracking system your company uses. \(For more on issue tracking systems, check out this link: [https://www.boundless.com/users/233403/textbooks/producing-open-source-software/technical-infrastructure-3/bug-tracker-23/](https://www.boundless.com/users/233403/textbooks/producing-open-source-software/technical-infrastructure-3/bug-tracker-23/)\)

**NB: **Git is not tied to any specific issue tracking system. However, since \_issue53 \_is a dedicated topic, you create a new branch in which to work:

`$ git checkout -b issue53                     // Creates and switches you to a new branch, issue53`

The figure below better illustrates the result:
