Moving from one branch to another in Git is as easy as 123. The enabling tool here is the \_git checkout \_command. The general command is

`git checkout branch_name`

where branch name is the 'destination branch'.

The following command switches us from our current _master \_branch into our new '\_testing_' branch:

`git checkout testing`

**NOTE: **The name of the current branch from which the pointer moves is not included in the command to check out. This is not a mistake; it's accurate as seen ;-\)

This moves the HEAD to point to the testing branch:

_**HEAD points to another branch when you switch branches**_
