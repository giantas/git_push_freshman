When you make a few more changes and commit

`vim test.rb`

`git commit -am 'make more changes'`

your project history diverges as shown in the diagram below

```
                                                          _**Diverged branch histories**_
```

---

**Your workflow:**

You created a new branch, testing, switched to and did some work on it, and then switched back to your main branch master, and did some other work.

**NB: **Both of these changes are isolated in separate branches: once ready with work on either branches, you can switch back and forth between the branches and merge them together.
