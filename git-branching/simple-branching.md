Remember that a branch in Git represents a separate or independent line of development, serving as an abstraction for the following three processes:

1. Edit
2. Stage
3. Commit

New commits are recorded in the history of your current branch, resulting in a fork in the history of your entire project.

The ease with which Git allows its users to add new features of fix bugs, regardless of their size, has made it a common practice for developers to use branches in their daily development process. 

The following sections explain how branches in Git make it possible to not only work on new issues in parallel, but also keep the main branch \(commonly referred to as `master`\) free from questionable code.

Happy study!
