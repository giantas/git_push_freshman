# Git Basics
Herein lies the most important chapter for the  reader. More often than not, the commands to be used by any Git user are captured in this section, ranging from setting up a repository for version control using Git to working with hosted repositories also known as remotes.

<!-- To the best of your ability make this section amazingly fascinating to the comprehension of the reader. This is the heart of this open curriculum; let it beat at a rate high enough but just below hypertension, and low enough to circulate knowledge-flow to the entire being of the reader.

Analogies are highly welcome in this section!-->
